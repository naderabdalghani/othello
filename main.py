RULES = \
    "Othello (or Reversi) is a strategic board game that involves two players on a (2^k)*(2^k) (usually 8*8) " \
    "square grid with pieces that have two distinct sides (white and black). Each of the two sides corresponds to " \
    "one player; they are referred to here as White and Black. The game begins with four markers placed in a " \
    "square in the middle of the grid, two facing white-up, two pieces with the black side up. Black makes the " \
    "first move. Black must place a piece with the black side up on the board, in such a position that there " \
    "exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) line between the new piece and another " \
    "black piece, with one or more contiguous white pieces between them. After placing the piece, Black turns " \
    "over (flips or captures) all the white pieces lying on a straight line between the new piece and any " \
    "anchoring black pieces. All reversed pieces now show the black side, and Black can use them in later moves " \
    "-- unless White has reversed them back in the meantime. Now White plays. This player operates under the same " \
    "rules, with the roles reversed: White lays down a white piece, causing one or more black pieces to flip. " \
    "Players take alternate turns. If one player cannot make a valid move, the play is passed back to the other " \
    "player. When neither player can move, the game ends. This occurs when the grid has filled up, or when one " \
    "player has no more pieces on the board, or when neither player can legally place a piece in any of the " \
    "remaining squares. The player with more pieces on the board at the end wins. "
